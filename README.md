## Description

Word embeddings transform words to highly-dimensional vectors. The vectors attempt to capture the semantic meaning and relationships of the words, so that similar or related words have similar vectors. For example "Cat", "Kitten", "Feline", "Tiger" and "Lion" would have embedding vectors that are similar to varying degree, but would all be very dissimilar to a word like "Toolbox".

The Word2Vec embedding model has 300 dimensions that capture the semantic meaning of each word. It's not possible to visualize 300 dimensions, but we can use dimensional reduction techniques that project the dimensions to a 2 or 3 latent space that preserves much of the relationships that we can easily visualize. 

Embedding-plot, is a command line utility that can visualize word embeddings using dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA or t-SNE) and clustering in a scatter plot. 

## Features

- Supports Word2vec pretrained embedding models 
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA or t-SNE
- Specify a number of clusters to identify in the plot
- Interactive HTML output

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher.

### Install via pip
```
pip install embeddings_plot 
```

### Embedding model

To use this tool, you have to either train your own embedding model or use an existing pretrained model. This tool expected the models to be in word2vec format. Two pretrained models ready to use are:

- https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-english/wiki-news-300d-1M.vec.zip
- https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-english/crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip

Download one these models and unzip it, train your own model, or look for other pretrained word2vec models available on the internet.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the tool from the command line.

### Basic Command
```
embeddings-plot -m <model_path> -i <input_file> -o <output_file> --label
```

### Parameters
- `-h`,  `--help`: Show the help message and exit 
- `-m`,  `--model`: Path to the word embeddings model file
- `-i`,  `--input`: Input text file with words to visualize
- `-o`,  `--output`: Output HTML file for the visualization
- `-l`,  `--labels`: (Optional) Show labels on the plot
- `-c`,  `--clusters`: (Optional) Number of clusters for KMeans. Default is 5.
- `-r`,  `--reduction`: (Optional) Method for dimensionality reduction (pca or tsne). Default is tsne
- `-t`,  `--title`: (Optional) Sets the title of the output HTML page
- `-d`,  `--dimensions`: (Optional) Number of dimensions for the plot 2 (for 2D), or 3 (for 3D). Default is 2
- `-th`, `--theme`: (Optional) Color theme for the plot: "plotly_white" or "plotly_dark" (default: plotly_white)


### Example
```
embeddings-plot --model crawl-300d-2M.vec --input words.txt --output embedding-plot.html --labels --clusters 13 
```
